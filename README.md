personal blog :) 

uploading comics and case studies and whatever else i feel like at https://starly.dev

theme can be found [here](https://github.com/aleylara/Peli-Kiera), although i have modified some pieces in both the html and css

note: tasks.py comes by default; i have not tested it (i've not bothered installing invoke)
