## some lessons from my internships

note: i have never done a swe internship, only sysadmin / infosec roles

---

1. **document, document, document**
    - i made day to day logs where i could dump notes from the day, which included things like:
        - running log of what i accomplished / meetings i went to (with meeting notes)
        - anything i needed to copy paste (like list of server names)
        - notes on how to do something
        - thoughts on how to accomplish something (eg: to build this pipeline, i need x to connect to y and send data to z)
        - section for jotting down what you need to do the next day / future goals
        - this is very helpful for final presentations / project report
    - i also had pages for specific things i'd be working with a lot to note down useful commands
        - eg: i made a page with useful clickhouse queries and docs i found myself referencing a lot
    
  
2. **set up expectations / goals and project timelines asap**
    - understand why your project(s) is important; why / how is your project providing value? can you measure that? what does success look like?
    - find people that are actually affected by it and talk to them (and follow up on their feedback!)
    - if you're struggling, try to set up a more granular timeline and ask what your mentor thinks to see if you're on the right track
   
3. **talk to people! set up coffee chats with anyone doing anything you find interesting**
    - your manager / team members will help you find people to talk to if you aren't sure who, given a topic / area you want chat about
    - come with a list of questions you want to talk about; here's [my list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WzSHwv_hTlsfgAC48OTBDUfOw5NFwRwygPLtYjf2DY4/){: .blue-link} for coffee chats
    - similarly, if you hear about interesting during stand up, you can just set up a quick meeting with your team member and have them run through it with you 
  
4. **have nice commits, code, and readme**
    - people are looking at them and judging you based on it because these are the main things you are there to create
    - might be worth looking at [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/){: .blue-link} or asking how your mentor wants commits and comments to look like
    - make everything you create as user friendly as possible
        - note down how to run your code, potential failures and how to remedy them
        - you will not be there to explain how anything works in three months
  
5. **if you find something annoying, see if you can quickly automate it**
    - bash is your friend
    - if you can't do it quickly, ask your mentor if it's worthwhile to automate it so other people can use your script

6. **read about the tools you're going to be using**
    - if you're not sure, ask for reading material and where to find internal docs about them
    - listening to talks about similar projects in other companies or how your team functions in other companies is also very helpful

7. **socialize with other interns, go to intern events**
    - at least there's free food
