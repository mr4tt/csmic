## some lessons from my internships

these are some things i found useful through my internships and are probably good guidelines for anyone doing one.


---

1. **document, document, document**
    - every day, i made a page to dump notes, which included things like:
        - running log of what i accomplished / meetings i went to (+ meeting notes)
        - anything i needed to copy paste (eg: list of server names)
        - notes on how to do something (eg: how to spin up a new server)
        - musings on potential ways to accomplish something (eg: to build this pipeline, i could use x to connect to y server and send data to z)
        - section for jotting down what you need to do the next day / future goals
        - these logs are very helpful for your final presentation / project report
    - i also had pages for specific tools/languages so i could note down useful commands
        - eg: i made a page with useful clickhouse queries and docs i found myself referencing a lot
  
2. **set up expectations / goals and project timelines asap**
    - understand why your project(s) is important
        - why / how is your project providing value? can you measure that? what does success look like?
    - find people that will benefit or have to change their workflow because of your project and talk to them (and follow up on their feedback!)
    - if you're struggling, set up a more granular timeline and ask what your mentor thinks to see if you're on the right track
   
3. **talk to people! set up coffee chats with anyone doing anything you find interesting**
    - given a topic / area you want chat about, your manager / team members will help you find people to talk to if you aren't sure who
    - come with a list of questions you want to talk about; here's [my list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WzSHwv_hTlsfgAC48OTBDUfOw5NFwRwygPLtYjf2DY4/){: .blue-link} for coffee chats
    - similarly, if you hear about interesting projects during stand up, you can set up a quick meeting with your team member and have them run through it with you 
  
4. **have understandable commits, code, and readme**
    - people are looking at them and judging you based on it because these are the main things you are there to create
    - ask your mentor about how they style commits and comments
        - might be worth looking at [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/){: .blue-link}
    - make everything you create as user friendly as possible
        - note down how to run your code, potential failures and how to remedy them
        - you will not be there to explain how anything works in three months

5. **read about the tools you're going to be using**
    - if you're not sure where to find the best resources, ask for reading material and internal docs about tools and libraries
    - listen to talks about similar projects in other companies or how your team functions in other companies
    - do not spend too much time rabbit holing into tools or the codebase at the expense of doing things 

6. **ask good questions**
    - make sure to google your question before you ask
        - if you didn't find anything, ask and mention what you found when googling 
    - anything else i have to say is [said](https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/){: .blue-link} [better](https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/10/21/how-to-get-useful-answers-to-your-questions/){: .blue-link} by julia evans

7. **if you find something annoying, see if you can quickly automate it**
    - bash is your friend
    - if you can't do it quickly, ask your mentor if it's worthwhile to automate it so other people can use your script

8. **socialize with other interns, go to intern events**
    - at least there's free food
