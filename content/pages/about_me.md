> *your about me sucks* -- A dear reader, 2024


Hello! I am a student at UC San Diego.

On this site, I write / draw about CS topics. 

## Some things I find interesting:

- devops
- observability
- begrudgingly, TypeScript types 
- Pokemon
- hacking incidents
- crocheting
- collecting [links](https://github.com/mr4tt/zotbot)
- reading sci-fi and fantasy
- finding a job :')

Currently recovering from minesweeper addiction.

Here is one of my cats being a menace:
