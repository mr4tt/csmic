        <h2>some lessons from my internships</h2>
<p>note: i have never done a swe internship</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>document, document, document</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>i made day to day logs where i could dump notes from the day, which included things like:<ul>
<li>running log of what i accomplished / meetings i went to (with meeting notes)</li>
<li>anything i needed to copy paste (eg: list of server names)</li>
<li>notes on how to do something (eg: how to spin up a new server)</li>
<li>thoughts on how to accomplish something (eg: to build this pipeline, i need x to connect to y server and send data to z)</li>
<li>section for jotting down what you need to do the next day / future goals</li>
<li>this is very helpful for final presentations / project report</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>i also had pages for specific tools i'd be working with a lot to note down useful commands<ul>
<li>eg: i made a page with useful clickhouse queries and docs i found myself referencing a lot</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>set up expectations / goals and project timelines asap</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>understand why your project(s) is important; why / how is your project providing value? can you measure that? what does success look like?</li>
<li>find people that are actually affected by it and talk to them (and follow up on their feedback!)</li>
<li>if you're struggling, try to set up a more granular timeline and ask what your mentor thinks to see if you're on the right track</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>talk to people! set up coffee chats with anyone doing anything you find interesting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>your manager / team members will help you find people to talk to if you aren't sure who, given a topic / area you want chat about</li>
<li>come with a list of questions you want to talk about; here's <a class="blue-link" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WzSHwv_hTlsfgAC48OTBDUfOw5NFwRwygPLtYjf2DY4/">my list</a> for coffee chats</li>
<li>similarly, if you hear about interesting projects during stand up, you can set up a quick meeting with your team member and have them run through it with you </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>have nice commits, code, and readme</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>people are looking at them and judging you based on it because these are the main things you are there to create</li>
<li>might be worth looking at <a class="blue-link" href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/">conventional commits</a> or asking how your mentor wants commits and comments to look like</li>
<li>make everything you create as user friendly as possible<ul>
<li>note down how to run your code, potential failures and how to remedy them</li>
<li>you will not be there to explain how anything works in three months</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>if you find something annoying, see if you can quickly automate it</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>bash is your friend</li>
<li>if you can't do it quickly, ask your mentor if it's worthwhile to automate it so other people can use your script</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>read about the tools you're going to be using</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>if you're not sure, ask for reading material and where to find internal docs about them</li>
<li>listening to talks about similar projects in other companies or how your team functions in other companies is also very helpful</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>socialize with other interns, go to intern events</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>at least there's free food</li>
</ul>
</li>
