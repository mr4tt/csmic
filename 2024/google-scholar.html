<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
<p>Google Scholar is a powerful search engine for researchers and academics to discover papers, books, and other materials. However, for beginner researchers, it can be difficult to find relevant papers. Furthermore, there are a variety of features that could be improved or added to make using Google Scholar seamless for all researchers and better accommodate all paper finding styles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How might we streamline the paper-finding process on Google Scholar to make it more accessible for users of all backgrounds to efficiently find relevant papers?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>User Exploration</h2>
<p>Our interview goals were to understand: </p>
<ul>
<li>How do researchers <strong>typically search</strong> for papers?</li>
<li>What are <strong>struggles</strong> researchers encounter when searching for papers?</li>
<li>What are researchers’ <strong>existing frustrations and desired features</strong> for paper finding?</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, we watched researchers’ normal workflows in searching for papers and gave a post task interview to reflect on their experience and elaborate more on their frustrations, wishes and reasoning for using certain systems.</p>
<p>Common Trends: </p>
<p>We found many common trends from each researcher’s thoughts and feedback from the tasks. Overall, <strong>8/9</strong> researchers used <strong>Google Scholar</strong> in some capacity for searching; only Chris solely used <strong>Semantic Scholar.</strong> </p>
<p>Two professors <strong>(2/9)</strong> we interviewed had very similar workflows and thoughts. They both emphasized the importance of being able to quickly decide if a paper is reputable. Some heuristics included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of citations</li>
<li>Venue the paper was published in (e.g. conference/journal)</li>
<li>Familiarity with the author(s)’ previous work</li>
</ul>
<p>Another commonality was how some features were left untouched when searching, like <strong>filtering</strong>: everyone exclusively used key words to constrain their search. </p>
<p>Because our users had many different research backgrounds, they had a variety of searching techniques. For instance, Devamardeep, an HCI researcher, used conference sites and Google Scholar to find papers. He emphasized the value of <strong>curation</strong> that conference sites provide, encompassing a standard of peer review and paper categorization that made it easy to search for papers regarding that conference’s specialization. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“[the conference site] is really nice because this is a conference that I know, and so I know that there’s going to be some standard of peer review.”
- Devamardeep</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, he found Google Scholar more useful for tracing papers once reputable papers were found or for exploring related papers outside of conferences.</p>
<p>User Wishes:</p>
<p>While our users had a process for finding relevant papers, many still mentioned features that would augment their search. </p>
<p>The most common ones that came up were having a <strong>curated content page</strong> and a <strong>visualization tool</strong>. <strong>4/9</strong> of our users, including professors and grad students, said that having a page with paper recommendations based on what they have read would help them find content they may be interested in. This was reminiscent of why Devamardeep would use conference sites: curation. In particular, Eric specifically mentioned TikTok’s For You page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Something applied like that to research would be helpful; if I’m notified about this unknown researcher who publishes something relevant to this thing I’m reading about, that would be cool.”
- Eric</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>2/9</strong> of our users mentioned that having some sort of visualization tool to show the level of relevancy between papers using a metric for a given paper would be helpful in identifying relevant content. Though there is a list of related papers for each paper, there is no measurement of <em>how</em> relevant the papers are.</p>
<p>Pivot:</p>
<p>Our original redesign was focused on arXiv, another search engine that hosts new, open access papers. However, <strong>8/9</strong> researchers used Google Scholar, rather than arXiv. Furthermore, there was a large amount of criticism about arXiv, like how the searching had low relevancy, causing users to use the platform only as a paper repository.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I fucking hate this search. Like, this core recommender. It doesn’t work… it sucks, it’s terrible…</em><em>I do not recommend [arXiv]. Honestly, I would not fix it. There are better solutions out there, why would you spend the time to try to fix it?” 
- Christopher</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, we pivoted to Google Scholar, as it was by far the most used platform while still having pain points that could be iterated on to achieve our goals of easy and relevant paper discovery.</p>
